### Basic git workflow

- Assign yourself an issue inside GitHub issues and label it.
- Create a branch from master that references issue number and label.
- Do the work and save.
- Commit the work with a message.
- Push your branch up to GitHub.
- Submit a pull request that closes your issue and request a review.
- Once a PR is merged, stash any uncommitted work and switch back to the master branch.
- Pull from the master branch.
- Lather, rinse, and repeat.
